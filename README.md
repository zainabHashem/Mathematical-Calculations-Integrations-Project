Functionality
Mathematical Functions

    f(x): Evaluates the function cos(x) + 6 * i * sin(2 * x) where i is the imaginary unit.
    f1(x): Calculates the function sin(x) * e^(x) using complex arithmetic.
    f2(x): Computes the function e^(x) * (x^2) with complex numbers.

Integrations

    Integral Calculation: Computes integrals of chosen functions using numerical methods and built-in functions.
    Trigonometric Fourier Series: Calculates Fourier series coefficients a0, ak, and bk for given periodic functions.

Usage

    Choose a function (f, f1, f2) to evaluate.
    Enter the integration limits (a, b) and other parameters as required.
    Run the script to compute the integrals and Fourier series coefficients.
